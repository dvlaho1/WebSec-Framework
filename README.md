WebSec-Framework
================

Introduction

This project was started because of the fact that students don’t have clear understanding of how Web Application Security works.
With this project, we’ll try to explain as much as we can to be sure that students gain clear knowledge and understanding of each Web Application Attack. ( e.g Sql Injection, Cross Site Scripting, Code Execution ).


What is WebSec Framework?

WebSec Framework is an Advanced Training-based Web Application Security Framework.
It’s meant to be used by individual educators and Training Centers if this Web App meets their needs.
It’s written in PHP and Mysql.
